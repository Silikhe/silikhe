I am a full stack developer based in Nairobi Kenya. I love solving problems with code. I mainly program in JavaScript but I've written some php, android and java and I am always learning. I love clean code and well written code and team best practices like CI/CD integrations and testing.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about java with [this course on coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming/home/welcome)
- 📝 I currently write about Android concepts I'm learning and Android programming and [my blog](https://blog..com) 
- 💬 Ask me about anything JavaScript
- 👯 Checkout my other github [SilSilas](https://github.com/Silsilas)

- ⚡ Fun fact: There are over 3 billion mobile phones are working in [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)), as well as 125 million TV sets and each Blu-Ray player. Another reason to love Java.

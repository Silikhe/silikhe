I’m a software engineer specializing in building both web and android applications that add impact the community. I mainly program in Android but I am also profficient in Javascript, php, Kotlin and java. For me everyday is a learning day YEEY!! I love clean code and well written code and team best practices like CI/CD integrations and testing.
